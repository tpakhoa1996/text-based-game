Introduction_Section
Welcome to our text-based adventure
===================================
Seven people, supposedly all friends, gather together to enjoy the evening. Then, you was busy and need to go out for few hours. When you cameback, one of them was dead!
What is it that drives one person to murder another? Is it from a sense of betrayal, jealousy or just plain spite? Does trying to conceal a deception, double-cross or infidelity force someone to take desperate measures? Will the old saying, "money is the root of all evil", hold true?
Who knows ... but then, you are an up and coming Detective out to solve crime ï¿½ specifically, homicide. That's your job. You pit your wits against people who think they can get away with murder every day. You will have to search the house and interview each suspect to find out "who is the criminal?" and "what is his weapon used to commit the crime?"
The murderer isn't so patient. He/she left a message at the crime scene, said "You are the next one!!". You have to do it quickly, otherwise another friend of yours will fall into his/her hand before you know it.
